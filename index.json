Courses made for ESSEC Business School (Global BBA).\nIn this course you will learn the basics of programming and programming with Python. Elementary notions will be displayed in jupyter notebooks. To use these files you will need to either:\n Install python locally (following the instructions below) Visit the interactive jupyter supports (made for online teaching without any installation required - but only available during courses - )  Please visit this link for interactive supports : https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gguibon/essec-python-1/master?filepath=python-1.ipynb\nInstall local Python environnement At home you may want to use Python locally. Please follow these steps:\n Download the latest Python (Python3 not 2) from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ Install it (if you are using Ubuntu 16.04 you already have Python installed)  Start using it:\n Open terminal(unix/mac) or CommandLine(windows), type python or python3 or py (depends on your environnement) to start an interactive python environnement Create a file named my_super_program.py, type print('hello') inside, and save. Execute this file by typing python3 my_super_program.py.  To run jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files with interactive python), please open a terminal and type:\npip install jupyter  Then run it using: jupyter notebook\nInstall developpement environnement To code with ease you may need an IDE for smoother coding. I would suggest Visual Studio Code combined with the Python plugin from Microsoft (ms-python.python). For a python only IDE the best one would be PyCharm.\nHere is the detailed procedure for Visual Studio Code set up from scratch:  Download and install the latest Python (Python3, not 2! Python2 is dead) from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ Download and install Visual Studio Code Visual Studio Code Install the Python Microsoft plugin in Visual Studio Code by clicking on the extension panel   :   Once it is done you can go back to the file view  , create a new file with \u0026lsquo;.py\u0026rsquo; extension (i.e. a python file such as \u0026lsquo;hello.py\u0026rsquo;), type print('hello') in it and save (Ctrl + S). Now you can run any python file you are viewing by clicking on the   button (top right). Here is an example:    Meet your instructor Gaël Guibon Are there prerequisites?

You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026quot;chart\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./line-chart.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-953627841', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  You might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\n1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ```  renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]  An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
